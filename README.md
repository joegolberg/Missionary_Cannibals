# Missionary_Cannibals Game

Only 1 or 2 people are permitted on the boat to travel.
We cannot select anymore missionaries or cannibals on the boat than the available number of missionaries or cannibals on either side.
You lose if the number of cannibals exceeds the number of missionaries on either side.
You win if you successfully transfer all the missionaries and cannibals from right side to left side.
